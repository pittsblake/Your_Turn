#version 2
In version 2, I would like to add more functionality to the site. I would like to create another page that uploads the description of the board game if the user clicks on it. I would also like to create a login screen, so that new users could create a meet up location and games. I would like to add more cities. Ideally every major city would be listed on the main page.
